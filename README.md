# py DRA

Python toy implementation of the Axolotl (Double Ratchet Algorithm) Protocol.

This implementation is meant to be a demonstration of the two major fragments of DRA: namely Triple Diffie-Hellman key exchanges and the two ratchets (symmetric and DH) used to achieve secure end-to-end message encryption.
